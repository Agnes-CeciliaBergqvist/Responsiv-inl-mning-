    <h2>Hey guys,</h2>
    <h3>This week we’ll be discussing the concept of  test<strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - another important game
        guideline.</h3>



    <h4>Youtubability</h4>
    <p> A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay </strong>to a potential player.<br>
        Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting <strong>the lowest
            possible CPIs</strong> for your games.<br>
        Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :<br>
        For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for example, can
        she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear? </strong>Does it look
        <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too
        long!).<br>
        Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix Jump,
        obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted </strong>(in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.<br>

            <div>If you want to run user tests with friends and family or even random people in the street, it is
                interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to
                <strong>understand their</strong> expectations f rom the video vs. the actual game they try.<br><br>
                <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help <strong>understand the objective and
                    controls</strong> of the game, like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or
                Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the space dedicated to drawing.

    <div class="centered-text">
            <div>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their phone’s Facebook
                    feed</strong>, everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your
                computer screen. <strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if
                    someone watches iton a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is
                an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!</strong><br>
                Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just because it has an
                attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea for your game videos.
