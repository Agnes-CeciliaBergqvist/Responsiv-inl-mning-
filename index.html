                This week we’ll be discussing the concept of
                <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - <br> another important game
                guideline.

        <h3 class="youtubability">Youtubability</h3>
        
        <div class="flex-box1">
            <p>A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay </strong>to a potential
                player.<br><br>
                Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting
                <strong>the lowest
                    possible CPIs</strong> for your games.<br><br>
                Many elements can be used to make your game clearer:<br><br>
                For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for
                example, can
                she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?
                </strong>Does it look
                <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
                seconds (too
                long!).<br><br>
                Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in
                Helix Jump,
                obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted </strong>(in orange here) and instantly recognized as a
                threat.<br>
            </p>

            <div>If you want to run user tests with friends and family or even random people in the street, it is
                interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to
                <strong>understand their</strong> expectations from the video vs. the actual game they try.<br><br>
                <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help <strong>understand the objective and
                    controls</strong> of the game, like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or
                Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the space dedicated to drawing.

    <div class="centered-text">
        <div>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their phone’s Facebook
                feed</strong>, everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your
            computer screen. <strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if
                someone watches iton a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is
            an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!</strong><br><br>
            Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just because it has an
            attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea for your game videos.
